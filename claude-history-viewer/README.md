## Security & Safety Best Practices

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: This tool is designed for LOCAL USE ONLY on your own machine.**

### Security Guidelines:
- **Keep it local**: By default, the server binds to `localhost` only. This means it's only accessible from your own machine.
- **Never expose to public internet**: Do not expose this server to the public internet without proper security measures (authentication, HTTPS, firewall rules, etc.).
- **Port security**: The default configuration uses localhost binding which prevents external access. If you change the host binding, ensure you understand the security implications.
- **Sensitive data**: Your Claude conversation history may contain sensitive information. Treat it with the same care as any personal data.

### Safe Usage:
```bash
# Safe (localhost only):
claude-history-viewer

# Safe (specific port, still localhost):
claude-history-viewer --port 8080

# UNSAFE - Do not use unless you understand the risks:
# claude-history-viewer --host 0.0.0.0  # Binds to all interfaces!
```

## Features

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g claude-history-viewer
```

## Usage

### Starting the Server
```bash
claude-history-viewer
```

This will:
1. Automatically find your Claude history files
2. Start a web server on an available port (default: 3456)
3. Open your browser to view the interface

### Stopping the Server
To stop the server, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where it's running.

### Running on a Specific Port
```bash
claude-history-viewer --port 8080
```

### Specifying a Different Claude Directory
```bash
claude-history-viewer --dir /path/to/your/claude/directory
```

### Options

```bash
claude-history-viewer --help

Options:
  -V, --version      output the version number
  -p, --port <number>  port to run the server on (default: "0")
  -d, --dir <path>   Claude config directory (defaults to CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR or ~/.claude)
  --no-open          do not open browser automatically
  --host <host>      host to bind to (default: "localhost")
  --dev              run in development mode
  -h, --help         display help for command
```

### Examples

Run on a specific port:
```bash
claude-history-viewer --port 8080
```

Use a custom Claude directory:
```bash
claude-history-viewer --dir /path/to/claude/directory
```

Run without opening browser:
```bash
claude-history-viewer --no-open
```

## How it Works

Claude Code stores conversation history in JSONL files located in:
- Default: `~/.claude/projects/`
- Or the directory specified by `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable

Each conversation is stored as a separate `.jsonl` file where each line contains a JSON object representing a message in the conversation.

## Development

To run in development mode:

```bash
git clone <repository>
cd claude-history-viewer
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Claude history directory not found"
Make sure Claude Code is installed and has been used at least once. The viewer looks for history files in:
1. `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable (if set)
2. `~/.claude/projects/`

### Port conflicts
The viewer automatically finds an available port. If you need a specific port, use the `--port` option.

### No conversations showing
Ensure you have used Claude Code and have conversation history. Check that the history files exist in the expected directory.
